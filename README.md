# AsciiDoc Image Helper

An Atom plugin for AsciiDoc grammar. Create image file relative to the asciidoc file and insert a relative url to that file.

Conversion of [markdown-image-helper](https://github.com/bigyuki/markdown-image-helper)ï¼Œinstead uploading the image, copying to the filesystem into a relative path is better.

## Usage
1. Take a screenshot or copy any image to the clipboard.
2. Paste it into Atom AsciiDoc editor.
3. See that an directory name "images" was created, the directory has a png file, and a url was inserted.
